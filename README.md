## Environment Variables

Security-critical parameters are managed by environment variables.
They are described in the following table:

| Name                           | Description                                                       | Default | Example                                  |
|:-------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------:|------------------------------------------|
| `BOUNDARY_ADDR`                | Address where your Boundary instance is hosted                    |   `-`   | `https://hashicorp-boundary.company.com` |
| `BOUNDARY_AUTHMETHODPASS_ID`   | ID of boundary auth method where the privileged user is stored    |   `-`   | `ampw_example`                           |
| `BOUNDARY_AUTHMETHODPASS_USER` | Username of boundary privileged user that perform synchronization |   `-`   | `user_example_changeit`                  |
| `BOUNDARY_AUTHMETHODPASS_PASS` | Password of boundary privileged user that perform synchronization |   `-`   | `super_secure_password`                  |

## Examples

Here you have a complete example to use this command.

> Output is thrown always in JSON as it is more suitable for automations

```console

export BOUNDARY_ADDR="https://your-boundary.you-company.com/"
export BOUNDARY_AUTHMETHODPASS_ID="ampw_example"
export BOUNDARY_AUTHMETHODPASS_USER="automation-google-workspace-groups-syncer" 
export BOUNDARY_AUTHMETHODPASS_PASS='super_secure_password'

bgos run \
     --log-level=info \
     --google-sa-credentials-path=le_credentials.json \
     --google-group sre@your-company.com \
     --google-group developers@your-company.com
```
