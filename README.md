A super UX friendly CLI to make daily connections through H.Boundary easy to do.

It covers common auth, targets listing, target connections by SSH, Kubernetes, etc 

## Motivation

Original H.Boundary CLI is designed to manage every administration aspect of Boundary (even the hardest ones),
but its usage is not friendly, and some flows are even bugged. This makes original CLI not usable on a daily basis.

This CLI wraps original CLI, fixing things such as UX and bugs on top of Boundary CLI, empowering people to use Boundary
in an easy and reliable way.

## Environment Variables

Only few parameters are managed by environment variables.
They are described in the following table:

| Name                           | Description                                      | Default | Example                                  |
|:-------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|:-------:|------------------------------------------|
| `BOUNDARY_ADDR`                | Address where your H.Boundary instance is hosted |   `-`   | `https://hashicorp-boundary.company.com` |
